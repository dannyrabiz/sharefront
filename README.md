# sharefront
Simple pricing model to evaluate the potential profitability of prospective deals 


## Background
[The Sharefront](https://thesharefront.com/) is a real estate startup based in NYC pioneering the concept of shared retail space in metropolitan areas. The idea is to join together otherwise unrelated businessesed in a partitioned retail space in order to create a synergistic collaboration between otherwise unrelated business, where the businesses could benefit from the additional cleintele attracted by the other companies in thier space, as well as, creating oppportunities for joint marketing campaigns and events.  

## Goal
The idea is to develop a straighfoward method to visualize the combination of businesses needed for profitability in that space. The idea is to input the projected costs and revenue based on the specifics of that location, for example, the square footage, rent, storage space etc. As of now, sharefront offers 3 different subscription models to their clients, the pricing varies with the number of space the business recieves - these numbers may also be subject to change based on the location or other factors. 

## Challenge
The users have no programming experience, so the challenge is to find the easiest solution for them to input new variables and interact with the data and visuals that are generated.
